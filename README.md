Calmi ðŸŒŠ
Your AI-Powered Haven for Emotional Support and Crisis Prevention

Calmi is a web application designed to provide immediate, accessible, and stigma-free mental health support. It combines an empathetic AI chatbot, crisis resources, and emotional tracking to help users navigate difficult moments and understand their emotional patterns over time.

Inspiration

The situation is particularly alarming in regions like Central Kenya, where high suicide rates among men highlight a critical need for accessible, immediate, and private support. Calmi was built to be a digital lifelineâ€”a first step towards healing that is available to anyone, anywhere, at any time.
